Quiz Game using Pthon 

the Python Quiz Game is an engaging and interactive quiz application that challenges your knowledge on a variety of topics, including programming, web development, and more. 
The game randomly selects questions from a predefined set, presents multiple-choice options, and provides immediate feedback on your answers.

creating a basic Python quiz application thatâ€™s only capable of asking a question, collecting an answer, and checking whether the answer is correct. Add more and more features in order to make your app more interesting, user-friendly, and fun.

CODE OF THE QUIZ GAME USING PYTHON LANGUAGE -

Build the quiz application iteratively by going through the following steps:

Create a basic application that can ask multiple-choice questions.
Make the app more user-friendly by improving how it looks and how it handles user errors.
Refactor the code to use functions.
Separate question data from source code by storing questions in a dedicated data file.
Expand the app to handle multiple correct answers, give hints, and provide explanations.
Add interest by supporting different quiz topics to choose from.
